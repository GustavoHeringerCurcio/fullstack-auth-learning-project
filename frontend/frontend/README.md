# Fullstack Auth Learning Project

This repository is my **first full-stack project**, created to deeply understand how a modern authentication system works — from the frontend interface to the backend logic and database integration.

At the moment, the project focuses on the **frontend**, but it is intentionally designed to evolve into a complete **authentication + chatbot platform** in the future.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is **learning by building**.

I want to clearly understand:
- how a real authentication flow works
- how frontend and backend communicate
- how user data is stored and secured
- how to structure a professional full-stack project

This project is not a tutorial copy — it is a hands-on learning exercise.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

### Frontend Setup & Tooling
- Setting up a project using **Vite + React**
- Project configuration and environment setup
- Using **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- Integrating **Flowbite** for UI components

### UI / UX & Layout
- Mobile-first design approach
- Responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Component-based UI structure
- Professional page and folder organization
- Separation of concerns (UI, features, pages, routing)

### Frontend Architecture
- Reusable UI components
- Feature-based folder structure (`features/auth`)
- Clean routing structure
- Scalable layout decisions for future backend integration

## 🧪 Current Project Status

✅ Frontend login UI  
✅ Responsive layout (mobile & desktop)  
✅ Clean and scalable folder structure  
🚧 Backend not implemented yet

## 🚀 What I Want to Learn Next

### Backend Fundamentals
- How frontend communicates with backend (HTTP, APIs, requests & responses)
- Building a backend using **Node.js + Express**
- Proper project structure for backend services

### Authentication System
- Creating a simple **CRUD system** for users
- Authentication logic (login, register, logout)
- Password handling and validation

### Database & Security
- Connecting the backend to **MongoDB**
- Storing and retrieving user data
- **Basic password encryption** (hashing & salting)
- Understanding authentication best practices

### Full-Stack Integration
- Connecting React frontend with backend APIs
- Handling authentication state
- Preparing the project to evolve into a chatbot system using **n8n**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Current & Planned)

### Frontend
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite
- React Router

### Backend (Planned)
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Basic authentication & encryption

---

## 📌 Future Vision

After completing the authentication system, this project will evolve into a **chatbot platform**, integrating automation workflows using **n8n**.
